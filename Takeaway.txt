MLflow is an open-source MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) platform that helps you manage the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It was originally developed by Databricks and is widely used in ML projects.

Here’s a breakdown of what MLflow is and does:


---

🔹 Main Components of MLflow

MLflow has 4 primary components:

1. MLflow Tracking

Used to log experiments (code versions, parameters, metrics, and artifacts).

Lets you compare runs and results in a UI.

Example: tracking model accuracy when changing hyperparameters.



2. MLflow Projects

A packaging format for reproducible runs.

Uses a simple MLproject file (YAML) to define dependencies and entry points.

Makes experiments portable and shareable across environments.



3. MLflow Models

Standardizes how models are packaged and deployed.

Supports multiple “flavors” (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, R, etc.).

Models can be deployed to REST APIs, cloud, or edge devices.



4. MLflow Registry

A central model store to manage versions of models.

Supports stages like Staging, Production, Archived.

Enables collaboration between data scientists and ops teams.



🔹 Why MLflow is useful

Keeps track of experiments systematically.

Helps with model reproducibility.

Allows team collaboration on ML models.

Works with any ML library (framework-agnostic).

Simplifies deployment to production.

🔹 Typical MLflow Workflow

1. Train model → log params, metrics, and artifacts with MLflow Tracking.


2. Package training code into MLflow Project for reproducibility.


3. Save the trained model in MLflow Models format.


4. Register it in the MLflow Model Registry.


5. Deploy the model via MLflow to a REST API, cloud service, or container.
